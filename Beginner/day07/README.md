# Day 7: Hangman Game

## 🎯 Project Goal
Build a command-line Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word within a limited number of attempts.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
* **Lists & Strings**: Handling word blanks and character replacement.
* **While Loops**: Managing continuous gameplay until a win or loss.
* **Membership Operators**: Using `in` to verify guesses.
* **Modular Coding**: Importing art and word lists from external files.

## 🛠️ How to Play
1. Run `main.py`.
2. Guess one letter at a time.
3. Correct guesses fill in the blanks.
4. Incorrect guesses cost a life and advance the hangman drawing.

## 📂 File Structure
* `main.py` - Core logic.
* `hangman_words.py` - Word bank.
* `hangman_art.py` - ASCII art stages and logo.
