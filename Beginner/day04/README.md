# Day 4: Rock Paper Scissors

A classic digital version of the hand game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" played against the computer.

## How it Works:
1. You choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors by typing 0, 1, or 2.
2. The computer makes a random choice.
3. The winner is determined based on the classic rules:
   * **Rock** beats **Scissors**
   * **Scissors** beats **Paper**
   * **Paper** beats **Rock**

## Concepts Learned:
* **Randomization:** Using the `random` module (`random.randint()`).
* **Python Lists:** Storing and accessing data in ordered sequences.
* **Index Errors:** Handling potential out-of-bounds inputs.
* **Nested Logic:** Using complex `if/elif/else` statements to determine the winner.
